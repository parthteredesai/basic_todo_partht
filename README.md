🎯 **Just built my own simple To-Do List web app!**

Using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, I created an interactive task manager that lets you:

✅ Add tasks
✅ Mark them as complete
✅ Edit them inline
✅ Delete them with a click

This project was a great exercise in:

💡 Practicing DOM manipulation
💡 Writing clean, modular JavaScript
💡 Styling responsive layouts for desktop and mobile
